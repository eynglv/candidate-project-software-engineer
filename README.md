Game is deployed at: http://game-of-war.herokuapp.com/

## Introduction
* Game is rendered and result is displayed in the console. 
* After forking, cloning, and installing all node dependencies
	1. Create a database named **War** with the command `createdb War` or with psql commands `CREATE DATABASE WAR` or with `npm run createdb`
	2. Run `npm run start:server` to start the server and webpack. 
	3. The app runs at localhost:8080



### Notes
* If I had more time, I would definitely implement a more thorough UI. I prioritized rendering the game's logic and making sure it worked without fail and connected to the API successfully. 
* In addition, I would have parsed the game logic out into more functions to keep the code DRY.  


## Submission
* Your submission should be accessible in a public git repository that includes a README.md with all the pertinent information of how to run your application. 
The expectation is that we can easily follow the steps provided and run the application without any guesswork.
* If your submission does include additional artifacts that are not represented within the repository - the README should provide information on how to retrieve and access these items.

* Details on anything further that you would like to achieve given more time, including any trade-offs that you may have made

Good luck and thank you for your time - we look forward to seeing your submission.
